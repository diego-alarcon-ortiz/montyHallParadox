Don't you know the Monty Hall paradox? Well, if you are interested, here it comes the explanation: https://statisticsbyjim.com/fun/monty-hall-problem/

If you already know, I saw myself forced to demonstrate that the paradox is real, some of my friends did not trust me!!! So I decided to simulate the game 1000000 times.

Know what... I got the 33%-66%, so it is not me, it is JS!!

It is a really easy but interesting project, some times you can solve problems in you daily life with basic programming.
